# Getting Started

Welcome to LyfeSchedule! This guide will introduce the most prominent features of this app.

## Create a simple task

After signing in, you'll be looking at the [Calendar view](./views.md#calendar-view) with today selected.

1. Click on the **Add task** button under the calendar to open the add/edit dialog.
1. Click on the **Title** field and type in "Try out LyfeSchedule".
1. Keep **Schedule** as it is (with today selected), **Repeat** as it is (unchecked), and **Time Estimate**
   as it is (checked and set to 15 minutes).
1. Click the **ADD** button. The dialog will close.

You will now see the "Try out LyfeSchedule" [task](./tasks.md).

## Edit a task

Actually, this shouldn't take more than 5 minutes. Let's [edit the task](./tasks.md#edit-a-task) to change the estimate.

1. Click on the "three dots" on the right side of the "Try out LyfeSchedule" task. This opens a menu of
   actions you can take on this task.
1. Click the **Edit** option at the top of the menu to open the add/edit dialog.
1. In the **Time Estimate** field, change "15" to "5", either by typing it in or using the arrow keys/buttons.
1. Click the **SAVE** button. The dialog will close.

<Callout type="info">
  At the moment, the task won't immediately update in the list. Click on today
  in the calendar again or reload the page to refresh the UI.
</Callout>

## Complete a task

Look at that, you've tried out LyfeSchedule! So now you can [complete the task](./tasks.md#complete-a-task).

1. Click on the open checkbox on the left side of the "Try out LyfeSchedule" task. The task will now be checked
   and gray.
1. Feel the satisfaction wash over you.

## Create a repeating task

One of the most powerful features is [repeating tasks](./tasks.md#repeating-tasks) - these are tasks that re-occur after a
certain amount of time, like many chores. We'll set up a example task here.

1. Click on the **Add task** button under the calendar to open the add/edit dialog.
1. Click on the **Title** field and type in "Wash the dishes".
1. Keep **Schedule** as it is (with today selected).
1. Click the checkmark to the left of **Repeat**.
1. Observe that the days when the tasks will repeat are indicated on the **Schedule** calendar above with the
   üîÅ icon. You can change the **Repeat** value and see how that affects the repeat days there. But for now keep
   the **Repeat** set to "every 1 day".
1. Click the **ADD** button. The dialog will close.

You will now see the "Wash the dishes" task today. Click on different days on the calendar and observe that
"Wash the dishes" appears on all those days too.

## Postpone a task

Any uncompleted tasks from previous days will roll over into today by default. However, as you are going through
your day, it's common to intentionally [postpone a task](./tasks.md#postpone-a-task) to a later day - whether something came up,
there are more important things, or you just don't feel like it, that's your call! Let's say you don't have
time today to wash the dishes, so you will postpone it to tomorrow.

<Callout type="warning">
  This is just an example, it's not recommended to actually leave dirty dishes
  unwashed.
</Callout>

1. Click on today on the calendar.
1. Click on the "three dots" on the right side of the "Wash the dishes" task to display the task options menu.
1. Under "Postpone to", click on **Tomorrow**. The task will disappear from today's task list.
1. Click on tomorrow on the calendar, where "Wash the dishes" will now appear in red. This indicates that it's
   overdue.

## Next steps

Those are the basics! Now you can start entering your tasks and using LyfeSchedule as you see fit. Here are some
more resources for your reference:
