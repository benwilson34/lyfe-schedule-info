This is a static site powered by [Remix](https://remix.run/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). The [source code](https://github.com/benwilson34/benz-house) is publically available; feel free to use the project as a starting point for your own site.

If you'd like to learn more about how this site was made, I've written an article about it: [how to make a static blog with Remix and MDX](/posts/how-to-make-a-static-blog-with-remix-and-mdx)
