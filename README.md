# LyfeSchedule Marketing Site and Docs

This is the source for the [marketing site](https://lyfeschedule.com) and [docs](https://lyfeschedule.com/docs) for [LyfeSchedule](https://github.com/benwilson34/lyfe-schedule), the todo app for people who get things done eventuallyâ„¢. It's built with [Remix](https://remix.run/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). It's hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and uses [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to automatically deploy the site when I push up changes.

This app is configured for static site generation (SSG). Read more here:
